## Algorithm Details

### 1. Planning Graph Construction

The solver builds a planning graph with alternating **proposition levels** and **action levels**:

```
Level 0: Initial Propositions
    ↓
Level 0: Applicable Actions + No-ops
    ↓
Level 1: Resulting Propositions
    ↓
Level 1: Applicable Actions + No-ops
    ↓
...continues until goal is reachable and non-mutex
```

### 2. State Representation

Each puzzle state is represented as a **set of propositions**:
- `tile_N_at_i_j`: Tile N is at position (i,j)
- `empty_at_i_j`: Empty space is at position (i,j)

### 3. Action Representation

Each action represents moving a tile into the empty space:
- **Name**: `move_tile_N_from_i1_j1_to_i2_j2`
- **Preconditions**: `{tile_N_at_i1_j1, empty_at_i2_j2}`
- **Effects**: `{tile_N_at_i2_j2, empty_at_i1_j1, not_tile_N_at_i1_j1, not_empty_at_i2_j2}`

### 4. Mutex Detection

#### Action Mutexes
Two actions are mutex if they have:
- **Inconsistent effects**: One adds what the other deletes
- **Interference**: One deletes the other's preconditions  
- **Competing needs**: Their preconditions are mutex

#### Proposition Mutexes
Two propositions are mutex if all ways of achieving them involve mutex actions.

### 5. Plan Extraction

Uses **A* search** with heuristics to extract optimal plans:
- **Priority queue** ordered by cost + heuristic
- **Backward search** from goal level to initial level
- **Mutex-free action combinations** at each level
- **Optimal solution guarantee**

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from puzzle_16_graphplan_optimized import OptimizedPuzzle16Solver

# Create solver instance
solver = OptimizedPuzzle16Solver()

# Define puzzle (0 represents empty space)
puzzle = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6, 7, 8],
    [9, 10, 0, 12],
    [13, 14, 11, 15]
]

# Solve the puzzle
solution = solver.solve(puzzle, timeout=10.0)

if solution:
    print(f"Solution found with {len(solution)} moves!")
    for i, action in enumerate(solution, 1):
        print(f"{i}. {action}")
else:
    print("No solution found or puzzle is unsolvable")
```
