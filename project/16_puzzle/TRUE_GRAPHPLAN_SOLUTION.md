## 🚀 **MAIN IMPLEMENTATION: `puzzle_16_true_graphplan.py`**

### **Core Classes:**
- `Proposition` - Represents facts about tile positions
- `Action` - Represents moves with preconditions and effects  
- `NoOpAction` - Special persistence actions
- `PlanningGraph` - The main graph structure with layers and mutexes
- `TruePlanningGraphSolver` - Main solver interface

### **Key Algorithm Components:**

#### **1. Forward Search (Graph Building)**
```python
def build_graph(self) -> Optional[int]:
    # Level 0: Initial state
    self.proposition_levels.append(self.initial_state)
    
    level = 0
    while level < self.max_levels:
        # Check if goals are reachable and non-mutex
        if self.goal_state.issubset(current_props):
            if not self._goals_are_mutex(level):
                return level  # Solution possible at this level
        
        # Build action level
        applicable_actions = self._get_applicable_actions(level)
        noop_actions = self._generate_noop_actions(level)
        
        # Compute action mutexes
        action_mutexes = self._compute_action_mutexes(all_actions, level)
        
        # Build next proposition level
        next_props = self._compute_next_propositions(all_actions)
        
        # Compute proposition mutexes
        prop_mutexes = self._compute_proposition_mutexes(next_props, level + 1)
```

#### **2. Mutex Computation**
```python
def _actions_are_mutex(self, action1: Action, action2: Action, level: int) -> bool:
    # Inconsistent effects: one deletes what the other adds
    if (action1.add_effects & action2.del_effects or 
        action2.add_effects & action1.del_effects):
        return True
    
    # Interference: one deletes precondition of the other
    if (action1.del_effects & action2.preconditions or
        action2.del_effects & action1.preconditions):
        return True
    
    # Competing needs: preconditions are mutex
    if self._preconditions_are_mutex(action1, action2, level):
        return True
```

#### **3. Plan Extraction (Backward Search)**
```python
def _backward_search(self, goals: FrozenSet[Proposition], level: int) -> Optional[List[str]]:
    if level == 0:
        if goals.issubset(self.initial_state):
            return []
        else:
            return None
    
    # Find all possible action combinations that achieve the goals
    action_combinations = self._find_achieving_action_combinations(goals, level - 1)
    
    for actions in action_combinations:
        # Compute preconditions for this combination
        preconditions = set()
        for action in actions:
            preconditions.update(action.preconditions)
        
        # Recursively solve for preconditions
        subplan = self._backward_search(frozenset(preconditions), level - 1)
        if subplan is not None:
            return subplan + action_names
```

puzzle_input = [2, 3, 4, 8, 1, 6, 7, 0, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 11, 15]

# Create solver
solver = TruePlanningGraphSolver()

# Solve using true planning graph
solution = solver.solve(puzzle_input, timeout=120.0)
